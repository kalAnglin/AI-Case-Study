# AI-Case-Study

## Overview and Origin [^1]

* Affectiva is artificial intelligence software development company that specializes in processing human emotions and cognitive states by analyzing facial and vocal expressions.
  
* Affectiva was incorporated in 2009 by founders Dr. Rana el Kaliouby and Dr. Rosalind Picard as a spin out of the MIT Media Lab.

* The company was founded on the idea or principle of humanizing technology to improve the interaction or experience between humans and machines. 

* Affectiva was provided with $53 million in funding by the following venture capital investors: Kleiner Perkins Caufield Byers, Horizon Ventures, Fenox Venture Capital, and WPP

## Business Activities

* The world is now saturated with smart devices and advanced AI systems, which have afforded humanity amazing cognitives achievements. Unfortunately, most of these technologies do not provide humanity same potential for advancement in regards to emotional intelligience (EQ). Affectiva's goal is to solve the problem that has created a gap between IQ and EQ by designing the AI systems around to create empathetic interactions with humans.

* The benefits of imbuing AI with emotional intelligence and beneficial in many different fields; however Affectiva's targeted base is consumers in the advertising, entertainment and participants in quality research in person and online. Affectiva reports utilizing a global dataset of over 14 million videos collected from 90 countries. Their Media Analytics solutions are used by 90 percent of the world's largest advertisers, and 26 percent of Fortune Global 500 companies.

* A key component that makes Affectiva's approach to Emotion AI unique stems from the cofounder Rana el Kaliouby's desire to utilize "Affective Computing" to help individuals with autism improve communication by providing tools to assist with understanding our sensory world prior to the inception of the company. Similar to Affectiva, many other Emotion AI companies implement complex multi-modal deep learing and generative systems to capture emotion through a variety of methods including facial expressions, tone of voice, environmental factors, social setting, and cultural context. However, in reference to the Kaliouby's initial interest in the autistic community, Affectiva differs by placing the desire to improve communication at the center their Emotion AI systems approach.

* Machine Learning Models based on Deep Learning are the primary technological approaches Affectiva uses to capture human emotion through artificial intelligence. Some primary ways human emotion and cognitive states are expressed are through facial expressions and vocal tonality. There is a large variety human expreession and tones of voice. In addition, these expressions or tones are constantly changing or adapting to new stimuli. This creates a complex problem that require a less straightfoward algorithm that uses deep neural networks to analye this evolvoing data and solve the problem of classifying, segmenting, modeling by automatically extracting features of the data to guide the learning process. Affectiva uses the following two deep learning architectures to accomplish this task:
  
  1. Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN)
     - Multi-task (multi-attribute) networks for both regression and classification
     - Region proposal networks
  2. Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN)
     - Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM)
     - Deep Recurrent Non-Negative Matrix Refractorization (DR-NMF)
     - CNN + RNN nets

### Landscape

* The field of Emotion AI is byproduct of Facial Recognition Technology familiar to most through science fiction movies but more notably through the advent of smart phones. All facial recognition systems a based on proprietary algorithms that perform three basic funtions:
    1. Detection - process of finding a face, not necessarily an identity.
    2. Analysis - maps the face by measuring eyes, shape of chin, distance between nose and mouth, and then converts that into a string of numbers or     
       points to create a "faceprint".
    3. Recognition - the attempt to verify a person's identity for security purposes.
 
* Speech/Vocal Recognition

 * The latest trends in the field of Facial Recognition data capture is incorporating emotion to provide analytics to advertising/retail, entertainment content, **automotive safety**, and behavioral research for humans and animals.
 * License Plate/Vehicle Recognition
 * Redaction for Security & Privacy
 * Vision AI Data - face and voice data collection for content creation
